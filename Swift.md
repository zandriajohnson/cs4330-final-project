Language purpose/genesis
  Why was the language created?
    Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of extant Objective-C (ObjC) code written for Apple products.
    
    ### Comparison Criteria

* Language purpose/genesis
  * Why was the language created?
  
  Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of extant Objective-C (ObjC) code written for Apple products.
  
  * What problems was the language trying to address?
  
  The goal of the Swift project is to create the best available language for uses ranging from systems programming, to mobile and desktop apps, scaling up to cloud services. Most importantly, Swift is designed to make writing and maintaining correct programs easier for the developer. Swift is intended to be more resilient to erroneous code ("safer") than Objective-C, and more concise.
  
  * Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
  
  Swift was written  as a reaction and improvemnt language taking ideas from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, and many others. 
  
* Unique features of the language
  * Does the language have any particularly unique features?
  
Closures unified with function pointers
Tuples and multiple return values
Generics
Fast and concise iteration over a range or collection
Structs that support methods, extensions, and protocols
Functional programming patterns, e.g., map and filter
Powerful error handling built-in
Advanced control flow with do, guard, defer, and repeat keywords
  
* Name spaces
  * How are name spaces implemented?
  * How are name spaces used?
  
  Swift doesn't support namespaces but as a solution you can create namespaces with stuck. 
  
* Types
    * What types does the language support?
    
    Swift supports: inferred, optional, enumeration, value, numeric, no-objective optional, and generic types. 
    
    * Are both reference and value types supported?
    
    Yes swift supports both value and reference types.
    
    * Can new value types be created?
    
    No they are copied when they are passed around in code. 
    
* Classes
  * Defining
 
 Class classname {
   Definition 1
   Definition 2
    --- 
   Definition N
}
 
  * Creating new instances
  * Constructing/initializing
  * Destructing/de-initializing
* Instance reference name in data type (class)
  * this?  self?
* Properties
  * Getters and setters...write your own or built in?
  * Backing variables?
  * Computed properties?
* Interfaces / protocols
  * What does the language support?
  * What abilities does it have?
  * How is it used?
* Inheritance / extension
* Reflection
  * What reflection abilities are supported?
  * How is reflection used?
* Memory management
  * How is it handled?
  * How does it work?
  * Garbage collection?
  * Automatic reference counting?
* Comparisons of references and values
  * How are values compared? (i.e. comparing two strings)
* Null/nil references
  * Which does the language use? (null/nil/etc)
  * Does the language have features for handling null/nil references?
* Errors and exception handling
* Lambda expressions, closures, or functions as types
* Implementation of listeners and event handlers
* Singleton
  * How is a singleton implemented?
  * Can it be made thread-safe?
  * Can the singleton instance be lazily instantiated?
* Procedural programming
  * Does the language support procedural programming?
* Functional programming
  * Does the language support functional programming?
* Multithreading
  * Threads or thread-like abilities
  * How is multitasking accomplished?
